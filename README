You will need the following library dev files to get this to compile:
	-FUSE (fuse.sf.net)
	-Filesytem Extended Attributes (libattr)
	-SSL (libssl)

In order to get it to actually work, you will have to run it in debug 
mode:

$ BuddyFS -d /tmp/buddy

It WILL NOT WORK correctly outside of debug mode.

The application will also ask you for a username/pass, so you'll have to 
set up the drm config file:

$ mkdir /etc/buddy
$ cp drm.conf /etc/buddy/drm.conf

Also, before you start, you will want to make sure fuse is loaded:

$ modprobe fuse

Once started, if you don't have a /etc/buddy/nodes.lst file with an ip 
address, a space, and a port number it should ask you for one. Same 
format with that.

If you have major problems, you can contact us at rcarback@sf.net and 
bpass@sf.net.
